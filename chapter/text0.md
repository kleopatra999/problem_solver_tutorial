[Goals](#chapter-0)
-------------------

Welcome,
to this hands on tour through the more often needed parts of this vast and beautiful
programming language. You can find here:

   - syntax knowledge
   - bits of deeper understanding for the design decisions
   - room for own experiments
   - a useful application
   - a taste of the full capabilities
   - sources for further learning (docs and more)



[Teaching Method](#chapter-0)
-----------------------------

While all the action takes place between "you and your computer", we try to
give you a feel that someone is guiding you in a real-world programming situation.
You will be able to follow a train of thought from the first strategic decisions,
to the selection process of finding the most suitable Perl feature,
then to the trying out of several ways to formulate it, up to the polishing edits.
A final evaluation helps to understand, what has been achieved.

That sounds like lot of text - but we actually do our best to keep it concise.
Links to more detailed information will be provided on the spot needed.
The tutorial also advances with a rather fast pace. Therefore we encourage you to
read a chapter or paragraph repeatedly, as long you feel like not fully getting it.
If an explantation just dind't made sense to you - please let us know via github.
It is most important to us not to bore and provoke your own inquiries.

The flip side of this practical, yet dense approach: you (mostly) have to stick
with the order of the content and won't be able to skip even several sentences.
Because then you overlook the introduction of an important feature, which will be
premised over and over. This is especially true during the chapter 1-6 and an
inevitable side effect of developing one program throughout the whole tutorial.
While we strongly recommend to adapt it to your wishes, you should be be aware,
that maintaining them through all changes can be a demanding task.



[Chapter Layout](#chapter-0)
--------------------------


Each chapter has a main topic and some (often related) subtopics.

if you ever wondered what Perl 6 is able
 to this practical Tutorial, aimed to people who learn the most while
our little tutorial: "Perl 6 for problem solver".
It's made for practical people. So writing working code will be the main vehicle
to show you the wonderful World of this well layed out language.
Theory and Perl philosophy will be taught on the fly and just enough to dive
into more complicated settings without getting lost. Not much programming or
computer science knowledge is therefore required, just an occasional 
lookup in wikipedia or a search engine.





> At the end of each chapter stands a working program,
> which hopefully becomes useful to you. 


During the course an application
It requires almost none background in programming or computer science -

[Prerequisites](#chapter-0)
--------------------------

   - curiosity
   - few programming basics
   - any editor
   - any shell, to run the scripts (unless you can do it from inside the editor)
   - an open browser connected to the net
