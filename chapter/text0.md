Goals
-----

Welcome,
to this hands on tour through the more often needed details of this vast and beautiful
programming language. It is designed to provide you with:

   - syntax knowledge
   - bits of deeper understanding of the semantics
   - sources for further learning (docs and more)
   - a useful application
   - room for own experiments
   - a taste of the full capabilities

   - curiosity

if you ever wondered what Perl 6 is able
 to this practical Tutorial, aimed to people who learn the most while
our little tutorial: "Perl 6 for problem solver".
It's made for practical people. So writing working code will be the main vehicle
to show you the wonderful World of this well layed out language.
Theory and Perl philosophy will be taught on the fly and just enough to dive
into more complicated settings without getting lost. Not much programming or
computer science knowledge is therefore required, just an occasional 
lookup in wikipedia or a search engine.

> At the end of each chapter stands a working program,
> which hopefully becomes useful to you. 


During the course an application
is built which might 
Each chapter
for teaches you enough of this 
It requires almost none background in programming or computer science -
just handling a search engine should be fine.
What it aims that filled in by quick search,
