[Goals](#chapter-0)
-------------------

Welcome,
to this hands on tour through the more often needed parts of this vast and beautiful
programming language. You can find here:

   - syntax knowledge:
   - bits of deeper understanding for the design decisions:
   - room for own experiments:
   - a hopefully useful application:
   - a taste of the full capabilities
   - sources for further learning (docs and more)



[Teaching Method](#chapter-0)
-----------------------------

While all the action takes place between "you and your computer", we try to
give you a feel that someone is guiding you in a real-world programming situation.
You will be able to follow a train of thought from the first strategic decisions,
to the selection process of finding the most suitable Perl feature, to the
following trying out of several ways to formulate it, up to the polishing edits.
A final evaluation helps to understand, what has been achieved.

That sounds like lot of text - but we actually try to keep it concise as possible.
Links to more detailed information will be provided on the spot needed.
The tutorial also advances with a rather fast pace. Therefore we encourage you to
reread a chapter or paragraph, if you felt like not fully understanding it.
Or you follow the trail of code snippets in a chapter. Running them as oneliner,
and and using them as basis of explorations might be your favorite learning style.
Rereading a chapter after that also clarifies a lot.
And reading the chapter after some minutes of such adventure can clarify.
When an explantation still doesn't makes sense to you - please let us know via github.
It is most important to us not to bore and provoke your own inquiries.

The flip side of this practical, yet dense approach: you (mostly) have to stick
with the given order and won't be able to skip even several sentences.
Because then you overlook the introduction of an important feature, which will be
premised over and over. This is especially true during chapter 2-6 and an inevitable
side effect of developing one example program throughout the whole tutorial.
While we strongly recommend to adapt it to your wishes, you should be be aware,
that maintaining them through all changes can be a demanding task.



[Chapter Layout](#chapter-0)
--------------------------

The strategy of building one none trivial application also disables us to expound
all topics in the order from A to Z. But even if we cater to the practical needs
of the task - each chapter has a main topic and several smaller ones, which are
often related to the bigger.
