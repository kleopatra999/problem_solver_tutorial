[Goals](#chapter-0)
--------------

Welcome,
to this hands on tour through the more often needed parts of this vast and beautiful
programming language. You can find here:

   - syntax knowledge
   - bits of deeper understanding for the design decisions
   - room for own experiments
   - a useful application
   - a taste of the full capabilities
   - sources for further learning (docs and more)



[Methods](#chapter-0)
-----------

While all the action might be mostly between "you and your computer", we try to give
you a feel that someone is guiding you in a real-world programming situation.
You will be able to follow a train of thought from the first strategic decisions,
to the selection process to find the most suitable Perl feature,
then to the trying out of several ways to formulate it, up to the finishing edits
of the implementation. Some evaluation helps you understand what has been achieved.

That sounds like lot of text - but we actually tried to keep it informative and concise -
advancing with a rather fast pace. Therefore we encourage you to read a chapter or
paragraph repeatedly, as long you feel like not fully understanding it. We think
that is way better than having to work through boring passages. Links to detailed
information will be provided on the spot needed.

The flip side of this practical, yet dense approach: you have to stick for the most
part with the order of the content and won't be able to skip even several sentences.
Because you might overlook this way an important feature, the next tho pages build upon.
It is one program, that developes constantly from front to back. Some parts stay
over long phases the same - other getting replaced quickly. While we strongly recommend
to adapt the program to your wishes, you should be be aware that maintaining them
through the whole tutorial might be a big extra task.



[Prerequisites](#chapter-0)
--------------------------

   - curiosity
   - few programming basics
   - any editor
   - any shell
   - an open browser

[Chapter Layout](#chapter-0)
--------------------------

if you ever wondered what Perl 6 is able
 to this practical Tutorial, aimed to people who learn the most while
our little tutorial: "Perl 6 for problem solver".
It's made for practical people. So writing working code will be the main vehicle
to show you the wonderful World of this well layed out language.
Theory and Perl philosophy will be taught on the fly and just enough to dive
into more complicated settings without getting lost. Not much programming or
computer science knowledge is therefore required, just an occasional 
lookup in wikipedia or a search engine.

> At the end of each chapter stands a working program,
> which hopefully becomes useful to you. 


During the course an application
is built which might 
Each chapter

It requires almost none background in programming or computer science -
just handling a search engine should be fine.
